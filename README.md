welcome to my first scratch project

the problem:

weather app sometimes are boring to see and has the minimum amount of data that you need 

the solution:

so the solution that I think is style the app and give more value information for the day and it helps me too improve my front-end knowledge


the basic: 
shows the weather daily and changes the background and the icon depending of the weather you choose

the advance:
add the time of city you choose, change the color of the page when the background change: give more detail information (daily, hourly, weekly) weather sunrise and sunset
